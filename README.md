This is a chess-game. The inspiration for this game is to check out my coding skills as it of this state. 
I know that the js-file is large, which shows that I am able to think very abstract in terms of coding skills.
This is usefull for difficult coding problems, however I will for next commits spread out the script into several files
for more readability. 

So, for any employers keep in mind that this project is only a test to see in what depth I am able to think advenced in terms 
of algorithm. Best Regards. :D
